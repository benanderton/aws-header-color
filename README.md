# AWS Header Color Changer

This is a Chrome extension that changes the header color of the AWS console to a color of your choice based on the URL being used to access the console. This is useful if you have multiple AWS accounts and want to easily differentiate between them.

Yes I know I'm English and I've spelt color without a 'u'. I'm sorry, I'm a traitor to my country - I shall hand in my stash of tea and crumpets immediately.
